The .exe file is in the dist folder. You can use any terminal it works on Linux and Windows
I have a require.txt file don't necessary have to install the requirements because .exe file has all the dependencies.
I have also a picture of how it should be outputed.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.

Thank you,
